          A provably fair algorithm is used to draw the lottery prizes. <br />
          Prizes are drawn at 15:00 UTC+0 everyday. <br /> You can buy a ticket
          for $0.1. The sale of tickets stop at 14:55 UTC+0 everyday. <br /> The
          player chooses six numbers for each ticket, the first five are from 1
          to 36, and the last one is from 1 to 10. <br /> You can choose numbers
          manually or automatically. <br /> If you have BCL, you can use BCL to
          redeem Tickets. <br /> Each draw produces six numbers. <br /> The more
          numbers you match in the first five numbers, greater prize you will
          win.
